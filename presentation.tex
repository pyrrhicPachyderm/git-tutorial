	I'm going to teach this over several sessions.
	Hopefully the first session will teach enough to just spin up a Git repository and start making commits.
	But if that's all you ever do, you're missing out on most of the benefits that version control will give you.
	So subsequent sessions will focus on how to get the most out of Git, and use it to be more productive.
